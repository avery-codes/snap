🙋🏽 Hello! This is my CracklePop program for my application to Recurse Center. If you are here to review my application, thank you for your time and consideration. Hope to hear from you soon. 

The purpose of this program is to iterate through and print a chosen range of integers with three variants. When the integer is divisible (int % int == 0) by one or both set of criteria integers, one or both strings are printed.
